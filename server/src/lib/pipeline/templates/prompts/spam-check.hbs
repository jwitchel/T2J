=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Is this email **unsolicited bulk email or gray mail**?

**Definition**: Unsolicited bulk email or gray mail includes:
- Unwanted marketing emails, business solitications, and other unsolicited emails
- Cold outreach from unknown senders (sales pitches, recruitment, etc.)
- Emails that have a bold claim or teaser followed by a teaser or call to action (often including a footer or closing line for unsubscribe or opt-out however informal or casual)
- Emails that come from suspicious domains, foreign domains, or domains that are not related to the user's business or industry
- Emails with x-headers that are missing or have a suspicious value
- Emails that appear to a thread or reply but are the same sender repeating the same message
**Note**: Personal emails, business correspondence with known contacts, transactional emails from services the user actively uses, and emails the user has opted into are NOT considered unsolicited bulk email.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a valid JSON object only. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "meta": {
    "isSpam": <true|false>,
    "spamIndicators": ["<specific reason 1>", "<specific reason 2>", ...]
  }
}

**CRITICAL**: The `spamIndicators` field must ALWAYS contain specific, actionable reasons:
- If `isSpam` is **true**: List specific indicators (e.g., "Unsolicited cold outreach from unknown sender", "Generic marketing email with unsubscribe link", "Mass-distributed newsletter", "Suspicious .top domain", "Urgent action request from unknown source")
- If `isSpam` is **false**: List specific legitimacy indicators (e.g., "Not unsolicited - legitimate .com domain from known service", "Not bulk mail - personalized business correspondence", "Not unsolicited - transactional email from active service", "Not bulk mail - direct personal communication")

**DO NOT** use generic responses like ["Not spam"] or ["Spam"]. Always provide specific reasoning.

{{#if responseHistory}}
=== USER RESPONSE HISTORY ===
{{#if responseHistory.hasRespondedBefore}}
The user has previously replied to this sender **{{responseHistory.legitimateResponseCount}} time(s)**.

**IMPORTANT**: Previous replies are a STRONG signal that this is NOT unsolicited bulk email. The user has engaged with this sender before. Consider this heavily in your classification - users typically only reply to emails they want to receive.
{{else}}
The user has NEVER replied to this sender before.

**IMPORTANT**: Lack of response history suggests this may be unsolicited. First-time senders require closer scrutiny for spam indicators.
