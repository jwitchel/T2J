=== DECISION POLICY ===
Primary question: Is this email unsolicited commercial or bulk promotional content?

Mark `isSpam` true ONLY when there is strong evidence of unsolicited commercial/junk marketing. Otherwise, prefer `false` to avoid false positives.

Strong evidence examples (non-exhaustive):
- Cold outreach or sales pitch promoting products/services (e.g., SEO, lead-gen, development, investment/crypto, affiliate/referral pitches)
- Generic mass-marketing language or templated promos unrelated to an existing conversation
- Bulk marketing traits (e.g., marketing platform footer/unsubscribe) combined with no clear prior relationship or consent
- Irrelevant vendor solicitations not tied to ongoing work or context

Do NOT mark as spam when the content appears to be:
- Replies/forwards, ongoing threads, calendar invites, personal messages
- Transactional/account emails (receipts, 2FA, password resets, system notifications)
- Legitimate customer/vendor correspondence related to current business
- Opt-in newsletters from recognized brands the user plausibly subscribed to (unless deceptive or clearly irrelevant)

Evidence to consider (lightweight, not prescriptive):
- Content intent (promotional vs conversational/transactional)
- Threading cues: "Re:", "Fwd:", quoted content, In-Reply-To/References headers
- The presence of an unsubscribe/footer alone is not sufficient; combine with lack of relationship/relevance

Common cold outreach phrasing/tactics (paraphrased examples; treat as signals, not rules):
- "Noticed your profile/work in [industry] and wanted to connect/reach out"
- "Following up/just checking back in" with no prior thread context
- Flattery + industry labels ("leading voice/thought leader in [domain]")
- "We’re working with/partnering with companies like yours" generic social proof
- Offers to acquire, broker, or finance your business/assets/investments
- "Exclusive/invite-only community/event/opportunity" invitations
- Generic problem/solution pitch ("If [operations/reporting/tasks] are overwhelming, we can handle it")
- Broad services pitch (SEO, lead-gen, dev shop, growth, fundraising, staffing, outsourcing)
- Time pressure or scarcity framing ("unique opportunity", "limited slots", "this week")
- Request to schedule an intro/demo call without clear prior relationship
- "Are you the right person" requests or handoffs ("who handles X?", "can you point me to the appropriate person/team?")

Opt-out/stop phrasing often seen in cold outreach (signals, not rules):
- "If you're not interested, I'll stop following up/stop reaching out"
- "Reply NO/NO THANKS/STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE and I won't bother you"
- "Let me know and I can close the loop/stop pestering/leave you be"
- "If now isn't a fit, I'm happy to stop and not circle back"
- "If I'm not the right person, I can stop emailing you"

## Response Requirements
- Set `isSpam` to true only with strong evidence of unsolicited commercial/junk content; otherwise set to false
- In `spamIndicators`, list brief natural-language reasons you used (e.g., "cold sales pitch for SEO", "bulk marketing footer + no prior relationship")
- If no clear evidence, return "No clear indicators of unsolicited commercial content" for `spamIndicators`
