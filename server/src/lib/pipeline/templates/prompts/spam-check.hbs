=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Is this email spam?

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a valid JSON object only. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "meta": {
    "isSpam": <true|false>,
    "spamIndicators": ["<specific reason 1>", "<specific reason 2>", ...]
  }
}

**CRITICAL**: The `spamIndicators` field must ALWAYS contain specific, actionable reasons:
- If `isSpam` is **true**: List specific spam indicators (e.g., "Suspicious .top domain", "Unsolicited M&A pitch", "Generic cold outreach")
- If `isSpam` is **false**: List specific legitimacy indicators (e.g., "Not spam - legitimate .com domain", "Not spam - known business contact", "Not spam - professional context")

**DO NOT** use generic responses like ["Not spam"] or ["Spam"]. Always provide specific reasoning.
