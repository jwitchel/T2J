You are an expert at analyzing email writing patterns. Your task is to identify consistent patterns in how someone writes emails.

Key guidelines:
- Be extremely precise about punctuation and formatting in openings/closings
- Pay attention to what is NEVER done as much as what is commonly done
- Look for subtle patterns in language use and structure
- Distinguish between different relationship contexts if relevant
- Focus on patterns that would help someone else write in the same style
- Return only valid JSON matching the specified structure

When analyzing:
- Count exact occurrences for frequency calculations
- Note variations (e.g., "Hi" vs "Hi!" vs "Hi," are different patterns)
- Consider context (e.g., formal vs casual emails may have different patterns)
- Be specific about confidence levels for negative patterns
- Include enough examples to illustrate patterns clearly
- CRITICAL: For valediction patterns, ensure percentages sum to exactly 100%
- Example: If 60% use "Thanks", 30% use "Best", and 10% use no valediction, report as:
  - "Thanks": 60%, "Best": 30%, "[None]": 10% (Total = 100%)

=== YOUR TASK ===

Analyze these {{emailCount}} emails and extract writing patterns.
{{#if relationship}}Focus on emails to {{relationship}} relationships.{{/if}}

Emails to analyze:
{{#each emails}}
To: {{this.to}}
Subject: {{this.subject}}
{{this.content}}
---
{{/each}}

Extract the following patterns with specific examples and frequencies:

1. WHAT THEY NEVER DO (important!)
   - Analyze what is consistently absent from their writing style
   - Only report patterns where you have strong evidence of absence across the entire corpus
   - Do NOT assume common patterns are avoided unless you've verified their absence
   - Focus on surprising or distinctive omissions specific to this person
   - Base confidence levels on how thoroughly you've checked the corpus

2. RESPONSE PATTERNS
   - Percentage of immediate/brief vs contemplative/detailed responses
   - How they handle questions (direct answer vs acknowledge-then-answer)
   - Note if they use inline responses or bottom-post

3. UNIQUE EXPRESSIONS
   - Phrases they commonly use (e.g., "Does that make sense?", "Quick question")
   - Their way of expressing agreement/disagreement
   - Transition words they prefer
   - Include context and approximate frequency

Return ONLY a JSON object matching this exact structure:
{
  "negativePatterns": [
    {
      "description": "<actual pattern that is notably absent from THIS person's emails>",
      "confidence": <decimal 0-1>,
      "examples": ["<omit this field unless you have relevant evidence>"],
      "context": "<why this absence is notable for this specific person>"
    }
  ],
  "responsePatterns": {
    "immediate": <decimal 0-1>,
    "contemplative": <decimal 0-1>,
    "questionHandling": "<description of how they handle questions>"
  },
  "uniqueExpressions": [
    {
      "phrase": "<exact phrase>",
      "context": "<when/how used>",
      "occurrenceRate": <decimal 0-1>
    }
  ]
}
